Chelsea
=======

Yet another location-based chat app -- built on top of Foursquare.

## Requirements

* iOS 7 with the Foursquare app
* Xcode 5
* CocoaPods

## Build

Install dependencies with `pod install` and open workspace with `open Chelsea.xcworkspace`.

## Run

Due to the Foursquare app requirement, Chelsea requires an actual device to run and will not work on a simulator.
