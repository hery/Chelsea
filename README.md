Chelsea
=======

Yet another location-based chat app -- built on top of Foursquare.

## Requirements

* iOS 7 with the Foursquare app
* Xcode 5
* CocoaPods

## Usage

* Login with Foursquare
* Check in at a location
* See who's checked in and start chatting with them

## Timeline

* Foursquare authentication complete
* Venue search complete
* Table view population ongoing
* Doc ongoing
* Tests ongoing
* Chat system ongoing

## Build

Install dependencies with `pod install` and open workspace with `open Chelsea.xcworkspace`.

## Run

Due to the Foursquare app requirement, Chelsea requires an actual device to run and will not work on a simulator.
